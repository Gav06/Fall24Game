## How to run

The game can be opened by using a Python interpreter to run the "game.py" file.
Make sure the "/assets" folder is in the same directory as "game.py" for this to work.
Additionally, to run this you will need the pygame pip package installed, 
which can be installed with the following commands (windows command shell):
```commandline
pip install pygame
```
or
```commandline
py -m pip install pygame
```

## How to play

Once you have the game launched, 
you can move around with the WASD keys for directional movement.
You can shoot bullets by left clicking the mouse.
Pressing the ESCAPE key will bring you back to the main menu.
